# Role Management System

This is a simple Role Management System built using React that allows users to manage roles and assign permissions. The system persists roles in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that data remains intact even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Persistent Data**: Roles and permissions are saved in `localStorage`, allowing data to persist across page reloads.
- **Role Creation**: You can add new roles by specifying a name and selecting from a set of available permissions (`Read`, `Write`, `Delete`).
- **Permission Management**: Each role can have multiple permissions, and users can toggle permissions on or off for each role.
- **Validation**: 
  - Role names cannot be empty.
  - Duplicate role names are prevented.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayeshWani7/RBAC-UI.git
   cd rbac-ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

### Managing Roles

1. **Viewing Existing Roles**: The roles are displayed in a table with the role name and the assigned permissions.
   
2. **Adding a New Role**:
   - Enter a **role name** in the input field.
   - Select the **permissions** (Read, Write, Delete) by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
   - Click **Add Role** to create the new role.

3. **Role Validation**:
   - If the role name is empty, you will be alerted.
   - If the role already exists, you will be alerted.

4. **Data Persistence**: After adding a role, the data is automatically saved to `localStorage`. Upon reloading the page, the roles will persist.

### Example:
When you add a role called "Admin" with the permissions `Read` and `Write`, the table will update, and the role will be saved in `localStorage`. If you reload the page, the "Admin" role will still appear with the `Read` and `Write` permissions.

## Code Structure

- **Role Management Component**: 
   - The `Roles` component is responsible for displaying the list of roles, adding new roles, and managing permissions.
   - **State Variables**:
     - `roles`: Stores the list of roles.
     - `permissionsList`: A predefined list of permissions (`Read`, `Write`, `Delete`).
     - `newRole`: Stores the new role‚Äôs name and selected permissions.

- **Hooks**:
   - `useEffect`: 
     - Loads roles from `localStorage` when the component mounts.
     - Saves the updated roles to `localStorage` whenever roles change.
    
# üîç Filter Functionality

The application includes a dynamic filtering feature to help users filter the displayed user list based on **Role** and **Status**.

## Features

- **Filter by Role**: Select a role to display users assigned to that role.
- **Filter by Status**: Choose between "Active" and "Inactive" statuses to refine the list further.
- **Multiple Filters**: Combine role and status filters for more precise results.
- **Reset Filters**: Leave the dropdown blank to reset and view all users.

## Usage

1. **Filter by Role**:
   - Open the "Role" dropdown.
   - Select a role (e.g., "Admin", "Editor").
   - The user list updates to display only users with the selected role.

2. **Filter by Status**:
   - Open the "Status" dropdown.
   - Select a status (e.g., "Active", "Inactive").
   - The list updates to display users with the chosen status.

3. **Combine Filters**:
   - Select both a role and a status to apply multiple filters.
   - For example, choose "Editor" as the role and "Active" as the status to view active editors.

4. **Reset Filters**:
   - To reset, select the default option (`All Roles` or `All Statuses`) from the dropdown.

## Example Usage

| **Name**    | **Email**           | **Role**   | **Status**   |
|-------------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| John Doe    | john@example.com    | Admin      | Active       |
| Jane Smith  | jane@example.com    | Editor     | Inactive     |

### Filters Applied:
- **Role**: `Admin`
- **Status**: `Active`

### Result:
- Only **John Doe** is displayed.

This filtering feature improves usability, making it easier to manage large datasets by allowing quick and efficient user segmentation.
