# Role Management System

This is a simple Role Management System built using React that allows users to manage roles and assign permissions. The system persists roles in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring that data remains intact even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Persistent Data**: Roles and permissions are saved in `localStorage`, allowing data to persist across page reloads.
- **Role Creation**: You can add new roles by specifying a name and selecting from a set of available permissions (`Read`, `Write`, `Delete`).
- **Permission Management**: Each role can have multiple permissions, and users can toggle permissions on or off for each role.
- **Validation**: 
  - Role names cannot be empty.
  - Duplicate role names are prevented.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Usage

### Managing Roles

1. **Viewing Existing Roles**: The roles are displayed in a table with the role name and the assigned permissions.
   
2. **Adding a New Role**:
   - Enter a **role name** in the input field.
   - Select the **permissions** (Read, Write, Delete) by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
   - Click **Add Role** to create the new role.

3. **Role Validation**:
   - If the role name is empty, you will be alerted.
   - If the role already exists, you will be alerted.

4. **Data Persistence**: After adding a role, the data is automatically saved to `localStorage`. Upon reloading the page, the roles will persist.

### Example:
When you add a role called "Admin" with the permissions `Read` and `Write`, the table will update, and the role will be saved in `localStorage`. If you reload the page, the "Admin" role will still appear with the `Read` and `Write` permissions.

## Code Structure

- **Role Management Component**: 
   - The `Roles` component is responsible for displaying the list of roles, adding new roles, and managing permissions.
   - **State Variables**:
     - `roles`: Stores the list of roles.
     - `permissionsList`: A predefined list of permissions (`Read`, `Write`, `Delete`).
     - `newRole`: Stores the new roleâ€™s name and selected permissions.

- **Hooks**:
   - `useEffect`: 
     - Loads roles from `localStorage` when the component mounts.
     - Saves the updated roles to `localStorage` whenever roles change.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The front-end library for building the user interface.
- **localStorage**: Used to persist role data across page reloads.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the components.
